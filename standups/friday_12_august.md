# Team Jesus

## What have we done yesterday
* Send requests
* Denying requests
* Approving requests (WIP)
* Links in the header (Spaces/Homepage/Requests)
* Added Bootstrap for styling
* Impossible to book outside availability
* Found out about Sinatra's @request variable
* Availability validations complete
* Some refactoring on code

## What are we doing today
* Lots of styling
* Deny all other requests for same date and space when approving one
* Unable to book a reserved night
* use jQuery calendar

## Struggles
* The first solution is usually the right one. GO BACK!
